# what2eat
It is too hard to decide what to eat for the next week, which makes grocery shopping frustrating. This project allows the computer to pick the entries for us (or make random suggestions). The script will send the shopping list to the TODOist app. When shopping, you just mark an item as Done and go for the next.


To use:

```
sudo pip install openpyxl
# configure your TODOist username and password in the config file, then
python main.py --meat 4 --vegetable 4
```
