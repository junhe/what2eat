# what2eat
It is too hard to decide what to eat for the next week, which makes grocery shopping frustrating. So we let the computer pick the entires for us (or provide choices to let us pick conviently) and send the shopping list to TODOist app. When shopping, you just mark an item as Done and go for the next.


To use:

```
sudo pip install openpyxl
python main.py --meat 4 --vegetable 4 --byhand
```
